# Final Exam
In class you will be asked to:

* Configure a java compiler
* Read, understand, and comment some Java files
* Compile and run the files

I will upload some sample code here soon for you to review.

The code will be distributed as a zip file containing several java packages.

## Grading
10pts - for setting up your Java compiler correctly.
70pts - for correct function commenting
20pts - for compiling and running the code.

## Sample Grade #1
If you 
* correctly set up compiler you get 10 pts
* correctly comment 5/7 functions, incorrectly comment 1/7 and leave 1/7 uncommented, you get 50pts
* compile and run the code you get 20pts

10 + 50 + 20 = 80

## Sample Grade #2
If you 
* Can't set your compiler you get 0 pts
* correctly comment all functions you get 70 pts
* compile the code but don't know how to run it you get 0 pts

0 + 70 + 0 = 70

## Sample Grade #3
If you 
* Correctly set up a compiler you get 10pts
* Correctly comment 6/7 functions you get 60pts
* Compile and run the code you get 20 pts

10 + 60 + 20 = 90
