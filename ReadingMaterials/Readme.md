# Reading materials
Here are some texts I've considered using for the class

* Think Java by Allen Downey. He wrote a phenomenal Think Python book, and his statistics books are crowd favorites. He's a professor at Oberlin College I think. Attends alot of conferences and his talks always fill the rooms.

* Making Music in Java. Cool book about how to make music with Java. Somewhat old and ( from a Java perspective ) very elementary. Quite fun to use and critique the jMusic library, however.

* Official Oracle Java tutorial
