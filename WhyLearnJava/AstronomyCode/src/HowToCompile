If you're on Windows I don't think the `find` command will work.
But I've included the JavaFiles file for you to run the second command, I think that will work.

#  How to compile                        #

#  find . -name "*.java" > JavaFiles     #
#  javac @JavaFiles -d classes           #

After compiling you will see that a new folder called 'classes' is there.
The folder was generated with the -d flag of javac
There are several files in there was can run. 

Lets go to the 'classes' folder ( I'll use the 'cd' command - if you don't know that, just
open a terminal in the 'classes' folder.

Then try this:

1. java rsf.astron.graphics.intro.SunMotion 
2. java rsf.ui.TextInputDialog 
3. Find another file you can run. What public static void method is guaranteed to be in the class you ran?
