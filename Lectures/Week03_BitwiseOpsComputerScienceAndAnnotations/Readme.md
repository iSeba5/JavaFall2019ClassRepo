# Week 03 Lecture
In this lecture we will discuss some raw computer science, bitwise operations, and look at Annotations in Java. Annotations is something of a minor topic in relation to the other things we're discussing, but I'm giving it some time so that we can review how it relates to what we've learned so far.

## Schedule
* 7:00 - 7:30 Bits, bytes, and binary
* 7:30 - 8:00 Hexadecimal notation 
* 8:00 - 8:10 Break
* 8:10 - 8:30 The byte datatype. 
* 8:30 - 9:00 Bitwise operations
* 9:00 - 9:05 Break 
* 9:05 - 9:35 Annotations + Review
* 9:35 - 9:45 Discuss Homework
