## Why Learn Java [ 7:00 - 7:20 ]
* Refute popular disparaging opinions about Java.
* Java is like other languages
* Show how you can write once and run everywhere
* Show the stuff you can do with java!
    * Android
    * Web dev
    * Embedded
    * Music
    * Astronomy
    * There is no limit to what you can do with Java. 

## About this class [ 7:20 - 7:35 ]

Class guarantee - do the work, talk to your peers and to me, in the end you'll be a competent Java developer.

Review the syllabus

You could take a class online but this class is better, and I'm going to make it worth your money.

I'm not a pro java dev, but I can write great Java code. If you master this language you'll be able to do what I've done and pick up a new language in a weekend, then write apps in it or whatever, and then teach a great class about it. But you have to take this first step and Java is a great language for your first step.

## Your first Java program [ 7:35 - 8:00 ]

Write hello world. See attached code sample.
Teaches you 90% of the language.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/unix.html

See `Code/HelloWorld.java`

## Break [ 8:00 - 8:05 ]

A little break to gather our thoughts.

## Object Oriented Programming [ 8:05 - 8:15 ]

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html

What is OOP. Use cases for it. Other languages that use it. 
1. Class
2. Inheritance
3. Interface

## Variables, Primitive Datatypes [ 8:15 - 8:30 ]

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html

Going beyond Hello world with primitives.

* int
* byte
* short
* long
* float
* double
* boolean
* char
* arrays

See `Code/Primitives.java`

## Control Flow [ 8:30 - 8:45 ]
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/if.html

* if, if-else, if-else if-else
* switch
* while
* for

See `Code/If.java`, `Code/Switch.java`, `Code/WhileAndFor.java`

## Classes and methods [ 8:45 - 9:00 ]
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html

15 minutes should be enough to explain functions.

Write a class with some methods that take no arguments and return no values.

See `Code/ClassMethodExample.java`

## Break [ 9:00 - 9:05 ]

Much needed rest

## More about methods and classes [ 9:05 - 9:35 ]
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/returnvalue.html
30 minutes should be enough to cover these cases.
10 minutes each, if necessary.
* Constructors
* Methods that take arguments
* Methods that return values

See `Code/Constructor.java`, `Code/InterestingMethods.java` and `Code/InterstingMethods2.java`.

## Homework discussion [ 9:35 - 9:45 ]
Discuss homework assignment.
