/**
 * This class will use threads to illustrate how one makes
 * a stirfry.
 * Stir frys require the preparation of a variety of ingredients that
 * cook at different rates.
 * The recipe I will use here is like this:
 * Boil some water
 * While water heats, chop brocolli and chicken into bite size pieces
 * Wait for water to boil.
 * When water is boiling add noodles. These will cook for seven minutes
 * Heat up small amount of oil in pan
 * Toss chicken into pan to cook for 4 minutes
 * add broccolli to pan and cook for another 3 minutes
 * Pasta is done - remove from the stove and pour into a collander.
 * Toss noodles with a bit of olive oil so they don't stick
 * Add stirfry sauce to pan and toss chicken and brocolli in sauce. 
 * Put noodles in bowl
 * Remove pan from stove and pour the chicken and brocolli over the noodles
 * Serve
