They taught me growing up that the primary colors were Red, Yellow, Blue.

But then when I learned to program they told me that the primary colors were Red, Green, Blue.

In computer science, colors are typically represented by a combination of 3 bytes, one byte for red, one byte for blue, and one for green. 

So the color Red would be 0xFF0000

blue is 
0x0000FF

and green is 0x00ff00

White is 0xffffff

and black is 0x000000

This makes sense because white has all the colors in it [ show a prism ]

and black has none [ turn off the lights ].

Today we will play with image formats and rgb values in Java.

Our end goal is to hide a message in an image. [ should I do the ascii / text encoding lecture before this one? ]
