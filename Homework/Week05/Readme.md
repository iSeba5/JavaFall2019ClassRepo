# Week 5 Homework

This homework requires you to play with bits and bytes in Java. If you can complete this homework successfully, you will have demonstrated a fine understanding of the intricacies of Java data types.

## Requirements

Starter code is available in this repository to help you get started.

In general you must: 
* Cast an `int` to a byte array ( of length 4, because an `int` is stored in 4 bytes in Java ). 
* Extract the last 4 *bits* of each *byte*.
* Create a `short` from these bits.
* Print the value of the short to the console.

Make sure you understand how to do this task as it is the basis of some hacking we'll do in coming weeks, as well as the basis of your midterm.

## Submission guidelines
Submit a '.zip' containing:

* your code
* screenshot of your code being compiled and running.

Due by midnight, October 4th ( the midnight between Tues / Wednesday ) via blackboard.
