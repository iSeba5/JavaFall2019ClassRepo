# Homework 3

## Introduction

The only way to learn to write code is by writing lots of code. I see a mixture of skill levels in this class and I want to level that out a bit.

The only way to learn to code is by coding! I suspect some people aren't sitting in front of a keyboard enough to understand how to write code, so this week's homework will force you to write alot of code. 

## Assignment Details

* Greater than or equal to 1500 lines of java. 
* ( 3 files, at least 500 lines each. ) 
* File names are Main.java, package/Class1.java, package/foobar/Class2.java
* Use if statements
* Use switch/case statements
* Use for loops
* Use while loops
* Write functions that take parameters
* Write functions that return parameters
* Write void functions
* Use enums
* Use packages( package and package.foobar, see the directory structure specified for the HW )
* Use primitives ( such as int, char, boolean, etc. )
* Use arrays ( such as int[], char[], double[], byte[], etc. )
* Use Strings
* Use the Number classes we learned ( such as Integer, Double, Float, etc. )

## Submission guidelines
Submit a .zip file which, when unzipped, contains the following directory structure:
 - - Main
   - Screenshot.png
   - - package
         - Class1.java
         - foobar
             - Class2.java

Your screenshot must indicate:
* the machine your compiled on + ran on is yours.
* You compiled on the command line.
* You ran the code on the command line.

Due Tuesday, September 24th at midnight on Blackboard. Not a second later!!!

You get a 100 for satisfying all the criteria above, and a 0 otherwise. Get it done! All you have to do is write alot of Java. Just keep typing until you reach 1500 lines - maybe keep typing beyond that.
