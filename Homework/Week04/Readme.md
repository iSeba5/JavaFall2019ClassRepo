## Homework 

* rewrite the Guitar code we wrote in class as a Singleton with a getInstance() method

* Add an `identifyChord(String[] notes)` function to your code.

* Put the guitar code in package 'guitar'

* put your main method in a different class, in a different package.

* Executing `java packagename.MainClassName` will create a file called 'DShapeChords.txt` containing the chords at each fret using the D shape on the guitar.

* file output should be:

```
Fret;Notes;Chord
0;Q,P,R;Y
1;X,Y,Z;Y
2;Y,W,Q;Z
3; ...
4;
5;
6;
7;
8;
9;
10;
11;
12;A,B,C;P
```
Where you identify the notes played using the D shape, barring fret 0 through 12, as well as the chord generated by those notes.
