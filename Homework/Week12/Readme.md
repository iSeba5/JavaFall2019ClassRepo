# Homework

## Problem 1
Read the Java tutorial about concurrency. Take screenshots of 3 different pages
in the tutorial. You might as well read it since you're already there taking
pictures.

The tutorial is here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/
You can click 'next' on each page to walk through the tutorial.

## Problem 2
Rewrite the sum example we did in class to instead find the product of the
numbers in an ArrayList ( and it must use more than one thread! ). I don't care
if you use *synchronized* or *AtomicInt* or whatever you want, just make a
little multithreaded application that computes the product of 1 through N-1.

*Use the code in MyCode/HomeworkTemplate to do the homework*

*NOTE!!! THe sum example started at 0. The product example cannot, or else it
will just return 0 every time, because 0 * n1 * n2 * n3 etc = 0*

## Submission
A .zip on blackboard by 26 November 2019 at midnight.
Zip contains:
* 3 screenshots of different pages from the tutorial you read
* Your code for problem 2

( you don't have to submit a zip if you've figured out how to upload individual
files. I just say a zip because a few folks told me they couldn't find a way to
upload more than one file. )

## Grading
50% - 3 pngs clearly indicating that they were taken of you and your computer
solving problem 1
50% - Code for problem 2 that *works*
